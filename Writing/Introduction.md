Question: Some people believe that university education should be free for all students. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
 
Answer:
In an era of widening socioeconomic disparities, the notion that higher education should be universally accessible without any financial barriers has gained traction. In my opinion, while the idea of free university education is appealing in theory, the practicalities must be carefully considered. It may not be sustainable in various circumstances.
 
On the one hand, advocates for free education often emphasise the societal benefits. Irrespective of financial background, tuition-free education provides equal access for all learners. This could contribute to a more skilled workforce, which is vital for a country's development. Moreover, it could reduce the gap between the poor and the rich, as people from underprivileged backgrounds will have similar opportunities to those of wealthier families. Therefore, offering free education would empower individuals to pursue their ambitions without the burden of student loans.
 
On the other hand, critics of free university education argue that this is not a practical or sustainable solution. To cover the free education expenses, the government might increase taxes, which is an unfair burden on taxpayers. Additionally, when education is free, it is undervalued. Learners show less motivation and commitment to their studies. Paying tuition fosters a sense of responsibility among the students and encourages them to study attentively and pursue their future careers.
 
In conclusion, while the concept of free university education has some merits, it may not be feasible for all students. A system of affordable tuition with flexible payment options, such as government loans and scholarships, could be a better solution.
