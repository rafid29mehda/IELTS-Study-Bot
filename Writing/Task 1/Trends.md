**In 2000,** company A produced 12 tonnes of waste, **while companies B and C** produced around 8 tonnes and 4 tonnes of waste material respectively. **Over the following 5 years,** the waste output of companies B and C rose by around 2 tonnes, but the figure for company A fell by approximately 1 tonne.

**From 2005 to 2015,** company A cut waste production by roughly 3 tonnes, and company B reduced its waste by around 7 tonnes. **In contrast,** company C saw an increase in waste production of approximately 4 tonnes over the same 10-year period. **By 2015,** company C’s waste output had risen to 10 tonnes, **while the** respective amounts of waste from companies A and B had dropped to 8 tonnes and only 3 tonnes.

**In 1900, around** 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. **The figures
for** industrial **and** domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. B**y

had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached
approximately 500km³
