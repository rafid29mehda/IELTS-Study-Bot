- - The diagram illustrates the process of using silkworm cocoons to produce silk cloth.
#### Natural Process
- The provided diagram **outlines the key stages involved in the** life cycle of a plant.

## OVERALL Paragraph

### Cycle
**Overall, the production of** ethanol is a **cyclical process that consists of** harvesting plants, extracting cellulose, converting it into sugars, adding microbes to create ethanol, and carbon dioxide produced when the ethanol is burned cycling back to plants during photosynthesis.

## Animal life cycle
Overall, we can see a circular progression **illustrating the metamorphosis of the silkworm** in four major stages: egg, larva, cocoon, and adult moth. The life cycle begins with the egg stage and ends with the emergence of the adult moth, after which the cycle can begin again with egg laying.

### Production
Overall, it is clear that there are six **distinct stages illustrated in the process, commencing with** producing eggs in the water and **ending with** the development of a mature frog. 


## Body Paragraph
- The process / production / manufacturing begins when

- At the beginning of the process,
- The ___ **undergoes dramatic physiological changes to become** an adult moth

### Words

1. Animal life cycle: egg, lay, hatch, emerge, predators, parasites, environmental hazards
