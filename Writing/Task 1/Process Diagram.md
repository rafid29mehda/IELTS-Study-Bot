## OVERALL Paragraph

### Cycle
**Overall, the production of** ethanol is a **cyclical process that consists of** harvesting plants, extracting cellulose, converting it into sugars, adding microbes to create ethanol, and carbon dioxide produced when the ethanol is burned cycling back to plants during photosynthesis.

## Animal life cycle
Overall, we can see a circular progression **illustrating the metamorphosis of the silkworm** in four major stages: egg, larva, cocoon, and adult moth. The life cycle begins with the egg stage and ends with the emergence of the adult moth, after which the cycle can begin again with egg laying.

### Production
Overall, it is clear that there are six **distinct stages illustrated in the process, commencing with** producing eggs in the water and **ending with** the development of a mature frog. 


## Body Paragraph

#### Overview
The diagram presents a circular progression illustrating the metamorphosis of the silkworm in four major stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis in a cocoon), and adult moth. The life cycle begins with the egg stage and ends with the emergence of the adult moth, after which the cycle can begin anew with egg laying. 

#### Stage 1: Egg (oviposition and hatching)
Eggs are laid by the female moth after mating. The eggs are typically small and slightly flattened. After fertilization, the female deposits eggs on host plants (usually mulberry leaves). After 10 days, under suitable temperature and humidity, the egg hatches into a larva. This transition marks the end of the egg stage and the beginning of the larval stage.

#### Stage 2: Larva (caterpillar) and its feeding phase

The larval stage lasts approximately 4â€“6 weeks, depending on temperature, nutrition, and strain. The larva is specialized for rapid feeding on mulberry leaves to produce energy in the form of silk proteins and spins them into a silk thread known as a cocoon.


#### Stage 3, 4: Cocoon and Adulth moth

The cocoon protects the pupa as it undergoes metamorphosis. During this stage, tissues and organs are reorganized to become the adult moth. This includes the breakdown of larval tissues and the development of adult structures such as wings, reproductive organs, and antennae. The primary role of the adult moth is to reproduce and lay fertilized eggs, which marks the initiation of a new life cycle. The cycle then restarts as eggs are laid on mulberry leaves for the next generation.
