## Map

#### Introduction

The maps illustrate the bookstore's layout as it was in 2000 compared to its present structure.

#### Overall

Overall, it is evident that the park has undergone considerable transformation, as very few areas have remained the same. The layout has been modernised (renovated) and made more visitor-friendly, with the addition of multiple outdoor facilities (interior amenities) to enhance the visitors' experience.

##### In place of "visitor-friendly"
- Connectivity and accessibility have been improved
- User-friendly / customer-friendly (library, museum)
- Recreation-centred (parks, community centres, or entertainment venues)
- Community-oriented (improved living)
- Entertainment-friendly (shopping malls, cinema complexes, or theme parks)

#### In place of "outdoor facilities"
- Recreational areas
- Green spaces
- Transport facilities
- Entertainment facilities
- Public services (school, hospital)
