## Template 1: Fully Agree/Disagree with Two Supporting Arguments
**Focus**: Strong, one-sided stance with two distinct pros (ideal for complete agreement/disagreement).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State full agreement/disagreement.
- Body 1: First argument + Explanation + Example.
- Body 2: Second argument + Explanation + Example.
- Conclusion: Restate + Broader implication.

**Detailed Template**:
In an era of [paraphrase prompt context, e.g., "globalization"], the notion that [restate prompt, e.g., "international travel promotes cultural understanding"] is widely debated. I completely agree with this view because [brief reasons, e.g., "it fosters empathy and reduces prejudices"].

The primary reason I support this is [first argument, e.g., "exposure to diverse cultures builds tolerance"]. This occurs as [explanation, e.g., "travelers interact with locals, challenging stereotypes"]. For example, [specific example, e.g., "programs like Erasmus in Europe have led to decreased xenophobia among participants, as evidenced by EU studies"].

Moreover, [second argument, e.g., "travel enhances global awareness"]. In practice, [explanation, e.g., "it encourages appreciation of shared human values"]. A clear illustration is [example, e.g., "tourists in Asia often return with heightened environmental consciousness, supporting conservation efforts back home"].

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly endorse [restate stance, e.g., "the idea that travel boosts cultural harmony"] due to [summarize reasons, e.g., "its role in promoting tolerance and awareness"]. This ultimately contributes to [broader impact, e.g., "a more interconnected world"].

**Tips**: Use this for prompts where you have strong evidence for one side. Include data/statistics in examples for credibility.

## Template 2: Partially Agree with Balanced Arguments
**Focus**: Nuanced stance (partial agreement), addressing both sides briefly.

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State partial agreement.
- Body 1: Arguments for agreement + Example.
- Body 2: Acknowledgment of disagreement + Counter + Example.
- Conclusion: Weigh and restate partial stance.

**Detailed Template**:
The question of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "whether social media harms mental health"] elicits varied opinions. I partially agree that [stance, e.g., "it can be detrimental, but benefits exist with moderation"] owing to [brief overview, e.g., "addiction risks versus connectivity gains"].

I concur to some extent because [agreement argument, e.g., "excessive use leads to anxiety"]. This is evident when [explanation, e.g., "constant comparisons on platforms fuel insecurity"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "studies from Harvard link heavy Instagram use to depression in teens"].

However, I disagree in cases where [counter argument, e.g., "social media supports mental health through communities"]. Provided that [condition, e.g., "users engage positively"], it can [explanation, e.g., "offer support networks"]. An example is [example, e.g., "online forums aiding those with anxiety, as reported by WHO initiatives"].

In conclusion, while [restate partial agreement, e.g., "social media poses risks to mental well-being"], its advantages [summarize balance, e.g., "in fostering connections outweigh drawbacks when used responsibly"], emphasizing [implication, e.g., "the need for balanced usage"].

**Tips**: Ideal for complex prompts. Use conditionals (e.g., "provided that") to show grammatical range.

## Template 3: Disagree with Refutation of Opposing Views
**Focus**: Strong disagreement, refuting counterarguments directly.

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State disagreement.
- Body 1: Refute first opposing view + Your argument + Example.
- Body 2: Refute second opposing view + Your argument + Example.
- Conclusion: Restate disagreement + Call to action.

**Detailed Template**:
Regarding [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "the belief that exams are the best way to assess students"], I strongly disagree, as [brief reasons, e.g., "they cause stress and fail to measure true ability"].

Opponents claim [first opposing view, e.g., "exams ensure fairness"]. However, this is flawed because [refutation, e.g., "they favor rote learning over creativity"]. Instead, [your argument, e.g., "project-based assessments better evaluate skills"]. For example, [example, e.g., "Finland's system, focusing on projects, yields higher student engagement per OECD reports"].

Furthermore, critics argue [second opposing view, e.g., "exams motivate study"]. Yet, [refutation, e.g., "they often lead to burnout"]. A superior approach is [your argument, e.g., "continuous evaluation, promoting consistent learning"]. This is demonstrated by [example, e.g., "U.S. schools using portfolios, resulting in improved critical thinking"].

In conclusion, I firmly oppose [restate disagreement, e.g., "relying solely on exams for assessment"] and advocate [call to action, e.g., "for diversified methods to nurture holistic development"].

**Tips**: Use for controversial topics. Employ contrast words (e.g., "however," "yet") for coherence.

## Template 4: Agree with Cause-Effect Chain
**Focus**: Agreement built on cause-effect relationships, emphasizing impacts.

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State agreement.
- Body 1: Cause 1 + Effect + Example.
- Body 2: Cause 2 + Effect + Example.

**Detailed Template**:
The debate surrounding [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "banning plastic bags to protect the environment"] is pertinent today. I fully agree, primarily because [brief causes, e.g., "it reduces pollution and encourages alternatives"].

One key cause for my agreement is [first cause, e.g., "plastic waste clogs oceans"]. This results in [effect, e.g., "harm to marine life and ecosystems"]. Consequently, [further impact, e.g., "biodiversity loss affects food chains"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "in the Pacific, bans in countries like Kenya have decreased marine debris by 30%, per UN data"].

Another cause is [second cause, e.g., "promotion of reusable options"]. This leads to [effect, e.g., "sustainable consumer habits"]. As a result, [further impact, e.g., "lower carbon footprints"]. A relevant example is [example, e.g., "Ireland's bag tax, which cut usage by 90% and funded green initiatives"].

In conclusion, I support [restate agreement, e.g., "plastic bag bans for environmental benefits"] as they [summarize effects, e.g., "mitigate pollution and foster sustainability"], paving the way for [long-term, e.g., "a healthier planet"].

**Tips**: Suited for environmental/science prompts. Use cause-effect linkers (e.g., "this results in," "consequently").

## Template 5: Disagree with Historical/Comparative Approach
**Focus**: Disagreement using historical or cross-cultural comparisons.

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State disagreement.
- Body 1: Historical comparison + Argument + Example.
- Body 2: Cross-cultural comparison + Argument + Example.

In light of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "the idea that traditional books are obsolete due to e-books"], I disagree entirely, given [brief reasons, e.g., "their enduring value in education and culture"].

Historically, [historical comparison, e.g., "books have survived technological shifts like printing presses"]. This underscores [argument, e.g., "their tactile and reliable nature"]. Unlike e-books, [contrast, e.g., "books don't require batteries"]. For example, [example, e.g., "during the Renaissance, printed books revolutionized knowledge, a role they still play today"].

Comparatively, in various cultures, [cross-cultural, e.g., "physical books remain preferred in Japan and Europe for deep reading"]. This supports [argument, e.g., "better comprehension without digital distractions"]. In contrast to [contrast, e.g., "e-books' convenience"], they offer [benefit, e.g., "lasting ownership"]. An illustration is [example, e.g., "Scandinavian libraries thriving with print collections, boosting literacy rates"].

In conclusion, I reject [restate disagreement, e.g., "the obsolescence of traditional books"] based on [summarize, e.g., "historical resilience and cultural preferences"], predicting [future, e.g., "their continued relevance in a hybrid world"].

**Tips**: Use for prompts involving change/tradition. Incorporate comparatives (e.g., "unlike," "in contrast to") for variety.
