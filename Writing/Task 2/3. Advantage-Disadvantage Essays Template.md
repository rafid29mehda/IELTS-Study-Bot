## Template 1: Balanced Pros and Cons with Advantages Outweighing
**Focus**: Equal discussion of advantages/disadvantages, concluding advantages dominate (standard for "outweigh" prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State advantages outweigh disadvantages.
- Body 1: Advantages + Explanations + Example.
- Body 2: Disadvantages + Explanations + Example.
- Conclusion: Weigh and restate view.

**Detailed Template**:
The phenomenon of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "working from home"] has become increasingly common. While it presents certain drawbacks, I believe the advantages outweigh them due to [brief reasons, e.g., "enhanced flexibility and productivity"].

The main advantages include [first advantage, e.g., "greater work-life balance"]. This enables [explanation, e.g., "employees to manage personal commitments effectively"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "parents can attend to children without commuting, as shown in surveys by FlexJobs indicating higher satisfaction"]. Additionally, [second advantage, e.g., "cost savings for both workers and employers through reduced office expenses"].

However, there are notable disadvantages such as [first disadvantage, e.g., "potential isolation"]. This may result in [explanation, e.g., "decreased collaboration and motivation"]. A case in point is [example, e.g., "remote teams reporting communication challenges in Google studies"]. Moreover, [second disadvantage, e.g., "blurred boundaries leading to overwork"].

In conclusion, although [acknowledge disadvantages, e.g., "isolation and overwork pose challenges"], the benefits of [restate advantages, e.g., "flexibility and savings"] clearly outweigh them, making [final thought, e.g., "remote work a positive trend for modern society"].

**Tips**: Use for prompts requiring a clear side. Balance paragraphs by number of points.

## Template 2: Disadvantages Outweighing with Mitigation Strategies

- Conclusion: Restate weighing + Suggest solutions.

**Detailed Template**:
In the digital age, [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "the use of social media for news"] raises concerns. Despite some benefits, I contend that the disadvantages outweigh them because of [brief reasons, e.g., "misinformation and echo chambers"].

The predominant disadvantages are [first disadvantage, e.g., "spread of fake news"]. This can cause [impact, e.g., "public misinformation and polarization"]. For example, [example, e.g., "during elections, false stories on Facebook influenced voter behavior, as per Cambridge Analytica reports"]. Furthermore, [second disadvantage, e.g., "algorithmic biases reinforcing existing beliefs"].

That being said, advantages exist, such as [first advantage, e.g., "rapid information access"]. However, this is limited by [limitation/mitigation, e.g., "fact-checking tools needed to verify content"]. An illustration is [example, e.g., "Twitter's community notes feature, which has reduced misinformation by 25% according to internal data"]. Additionally, [second advantage with mitigation, e.g., "diverse viewpoints, but users must curate feeds carefully"].

In conclusion, while [summarize advantages, e.g., "quick access offers value"], the drawbacks [restate weighing, e.g., "of misinformation prevail"], necessitating [suggest solutions, e.g., "stricter regulations and user education for safer usage"].

**Tips**: Ideal for negative-leaning topics. Use concessives (e.g., "that being said") to transition smoothly.

## Template 3: Thematic Pros and Cons (e.g., Economic vs. Social)
**Focus**: Group advantages/disadvantages by themes (e.g., economic/social), with a balanced or weighed opinion (for multi-dimensional prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + Outline themes + State opinion on outweighing.
- Body 1: Theme 1 (e.g., Economic) + Pros/Cons + Example.

- Conclusion: Synthesize themes + Restate view.

**Detailed Template**:
The expansion of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "urbanization"] brings both opportunities and challenges. Economically and socially, while advantages exist, I believe they are outweighed by disadvantages due to [brief overview, e.g., "overcrowding and inequality"].

Economically, advantages include [pro, e.g., "job creation and infrastructure development"]. This fosters [explanation, e.g., "growth in cities like Dubai"]. However, disadvantages such as [con, e.g., "rising living costs"] lead to [impact, e.g., "affordability issues"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "in New York, high rents have displaced low-income families, per Census data"].

Socially, benefits encompass [pro, e.g., "cultural diversity and networking"]. Yet, drawbacks like [con, e.g., "social isolation in dense populations"] prevail, causing [impact, e.g., "mental health strains"]. An example is [example, e.g., "Tokyo's high suicide rates linked to urban stress, as reported by WHO"].

In conclusion, across economic and social themes, [synthesize, e.g., "urbanization's growth benefits are eclipsed by cost and isolation issues"], affirming that [restate view, e.g., "disadvantages outweigh advantages"], calling for [implication, e.g., "planned sustainable development"].

**Tips**: Use for complex prompts. Thematic transitions (e.g., "economically," "socially") improve coherence.

## Template 4: Pros First with Refutation of Cons
**Focus**: Lead with advantages, then refute disadvantages to argue pros outweigh (persuasive for positive-leaning prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State pros outweigh cons.
- Body 1: Advantages + Explanations + Example.
- Body 2: Disadvantages + Refutations + Example.
- Conclusion: Reinforce pros + Final weighing.

**Detailed Template**:
With globalization, [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "international trade agreements"] have pros and cons. I maintain that the advantages surpass the disadvantages owing to [brief reasons, e.g., "economic boosts and innovation"].

Foremost among advantages is [first pro, e.g., "increased market access"]. This promotes [explanation, e.g., "export growth and job creation"]. For example, [example, e.g., "NAFTA enhanced U.S.-Mexico trade, creating millions of jobs per World Bank analyses"]. In addition, [second pro, e.g., "technology transfer fostering development"].

Critics highlight disadvantages like [first con, e.g., "job losses in certain sectors"]. Yet, this can be refuted by [refutation, e.g., "retraining programs offsetting impacts"]. A pertinent example is [example, e.g., "EU's adjustment funds aiding displaced workers post-trade deals"]. Similarly, [second con with refutation, e.g., "inequality, but progressive taxes can redistribute benefits"].

In conclusion, despite [acknowledge cons, e.g., "sectoral disruptions"], [reinforce pros, e.g., "trade's economic and innovative gains prevail"], confirming [final weighing, e.g., "advantages outweigh disadvantages in a connected world"].

**Tips**: Persuasive style; use refutative language (e.g., "yet," "can be refuted by") for critical thinking.

## Template 5: Cons First with Future Projections
**Focus**: Start with disadvantages, project future advantages to argue pros will outweigh (for evolving topics like tech/environment).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State pros outweigh cons in long term.
- Body 1: Disadvantages + Current Impacts + Example.
- Body 2: Advantages + Future Projections + Example.
- Conclusion: Project balance + Restate view.

**Detailed Template**:
The rise of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "renewable energy adoption"] entails benefits and challenges. Although disadvantages are evident now, I argue advantages will outweigh them in the future due to [brief overview, e.g., "technological advancements"].

Currently, disadvantages involve [first con, e.g., "high initial costs"]. This results in [impact, e.g., "slow uptake in developing nations"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "solar panel expenses in Africa delaying transitions, per IRENA reports"]. Moreover, [second con, e.g., "intermittency requiring backups"].

Looking ahead, advantages such as [first pro, e.g., "reduced emissions"] will dominate as [projection, e.g., "costs fall with innovation"]. This projects [future impact, e.g., "global carbon cuts by 2050"]. An example is [example, e.g., "Germany's Energiewende, where renewables now supply 40% power affordably"]. Additionally, [second pro with projection, e.g., "job creation in green sectors, forecasted to boom"].

In conclusion, while [summarize current cons, e.g., "costs hinder renewables today"], future advantages [restate view, e.g., "in sustainability and employment will prevail"], envisioning [projection, e.g., "a cleaner planet"].

**Tips**: For forward-thinking prompts. Use future tenses (e.g., "will dominate," "projected to") for speculation.

### Notebook Integration Tips
