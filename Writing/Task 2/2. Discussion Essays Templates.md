**Focus**: Neutral presentation of both views, followed by a clear personal opinion in the conclusion (suitable for neutral prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + Outline both views + State opinion briefly.
- Body 1: First view + Explanation + Example.
- Body 2: Second view + Explanation + Example.

**Detailed Template**:
The topic of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "whether online learning surpasses traditional classrooms"] has sparked ongoing debate. Some believe [first view, e.g., "digital education offers flexibility"], whereas others maintain [second view, e.g., "face-to-face interaction is irreplaceable"]. In my view, [your opinion, e.g., "a hybrid approach is optimal"].

Supporters of [first view, e.g., "online learning"] argue that [explanation, e.g., "it allows access anytime, anywhere, benefiting remote students"]. This is advantageous because [further detail, e.g., "it reduces costs and accommodates diverse schedules"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "during the COVID-19 pandemic, platforms like Zoom enabled uninterrupted education for millions globally"].

Conversely, advocates for [second view, e.g., "traditional classrooms"] emphasize [explanation, e.g., "direct interaction fosters deeper understanding and social skills"]. This holds true as [further detail, e.g., "teachers can provide immediate feedback"]. A notable example is [example, e.g., "studies from Harvard showing higher engagement in in-person settings compared to virtual ones"].

In conclusion, while both [summarize views, e.g., "online flexibility and classroom interaction have merits"], I believe [restate opinion, e.g., "combining them maximizes educational outcomes"], promoting [implication, e.g., "inclusive and effective learning"].

**Tips**: Use this for prompts with equally strong sides. Ensure examples are specific to demonstrate lexical range.

## Template 2: View 1 Dominant with Concessions to View 2

In contemporary society, [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "the impact of advertising on consumer behavior"] is a contentious issue. Proponents claim [first view, e.g., "it informs choices"], while critics argue [second view, e.g., "it manipulates purchases"]. Although both have validity, I lean toward [your opinion, e.g., "the informative role"].

Primarily, [first view, e.g., "advertising educates consumers"] by [explanation, e.g., "highlighting product features and comparisons"]. This empowers [further detail, e.g., "informed decisions in competitive markets"]. For example, [example, e.g., "campaigns for eco-friendly products have raised awareness, leading to sustainable buying trends as per Nielsen reports"].

That said, [second view, e.g., "manipulation through ads"] cannot be dismissed, as [concession, e.g., "emotional appeals can lead to impulse buys"]. Nevertheless, [refutation, e.g., "regulations mitigate this, ensuring ethical practices"]. An illustration is [example, e.g., "EU laws banning misleading ads, which have reduced consumer complaints"].

In conclusion, despite [acknowledge second view, e.g., "potential for manipulation"], [restate opinion, e.g., "advertising's benefits in informing outweigh drawbacks"], fostering [implication, e.g., "a transparent marketplace"].

**Tips**: Good for opinion-leaning prompts. Use concessive language (e.g., "that said," "nevertheless") for coherence.

## Template 3: Thematic Discussion with Integrated Opinion
**Focus**: Organize by themes (e.g., economic vs. social), integrating opinion throughout (for multifaceted prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + Outline views via themes + State opinion.
- Body 1: Theme 1 (linked to one view) + Discussion + Example.

**Detailed Template**:
The dilemma of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection"] divides opinions. Economically, some favor [first view, e.g., "growth for prosperity"], but environmentally, others prioritize [second view, e.g., "sustainability"]. I support [your opinion, e.g., "environmental priority for long-term viability"].

From an economic perspective, [first view, e.g., "growth drives jobs and innovation"]. This is compelling because [explanation, e.g., "it alleviates poverty through development"]. However, [integrate opinion, e.g., "unchecked growth harms ecosystems"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "China's industrial boom improved GDP but caused severe air pollution"].

Environmentally, [second view, e.g., "protection ensures resource preservation"]. This aligns with my view as [explanation, e.g., "it prevents irreversible damage"]. For example, [example, e.g., "Norway's oil revenue invested in green tech, balancing economy and ecology successfully"].

In conclusion, while economic [summarize first theme, e.g., "growth offers short-term gains"], environmental [summarize second, e.g., "safeguards are crucial"], reinforcing my belief in [restate opinion, e.g., "prioritizing sustainability for enduring prosperity"].

**Tips**: Use for prompts with multiple angles. Thematic linkers (e.g., "from an economic perspective") enhance structure.

## Template 4: View Comparison with Evidence-Based Opinion
**Focus**: Compare views directly with evidence (studies/data), building to an evidence-supported opinion (for research-oriented prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + Outline views + Preview evidence-based opinion.
- Body 1: View 1 + Evidence/Example + Comparison.

Discussions on [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "the effectiveness of prison sentences versus rehabilitation for criminals"] reveal contrasting views. One side endorses [first view, e.g., "deterrence through incarceration"], the other [second view, e.g., "reform via programs"]. Based on evidence, I favor [your opinion, e.g., "rehabilitation"].

Advocates of [first view, e.g., "prison as punishment"] cite [explanation, e.g., "it deters crime through fear"]. Evidence supports this partially, as [evidence, e.g., "U.S. studies show short-term reductions in reoffending"]. However, [comparison, e.g., "long-term recidivism remains high at 60%, per Bureau of Justice data"].

In contrast, [second view, e.g., "rehabilitation focuses on root causes"]. This is backed by [explanation, e.g., "skills training reducing relapse"]. For instance, [evidence/example, e.g., "Norway's rehab model yields 20% recidivism rates, far lower than punitive systems, according to OECD reports"].

In conclusion, although [weigh evidence, e.g., "prisons offer deterrence, evidence favors rehabilitation's lower recidivism"], I advocate [restate opinion, e.g., "reformative approaches for societal benefit"].

**Tips**: Incorporate stats/studies for lexical precision. Use comparative phrases (e.g., "in contrast," "however").

## Template 5: Future-Oriented Discussion with Predictive Opinion
**Focus**: Discuss views with future implications, predicting outcomes in opinion (for forward-looking prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + Outline views + State predictive opinion.
- Body 1: View 1 + Current/Future Implications + Example.
- Body 2: View 2 + Current/Future Implications + Example.

**Detailed Template**:
The evolving issue of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "artificial intelligence replacing human jobs"] presents divergent opinions. Some foresee [first view, e.g., "widespread unemployment"], others [second view, e.g., "new opportunities"]. In my prediction, [your opinion, e.g., "AI will create more jobs than it displaces"].

Those warning of [first view, e.g., "job loss"] point to [explanation, e.g., "automation in manufacturing"]. Currently, this causes [implication, e.g., "displacement"], and future-wise, [prediction, e.g., "could exacerbate inequality"]. For example, [example, e.g., "factory robots in the auto industry have reduced roles, as seen in Detroit's decline"].

Alternatively, optimists for [second view, e.g., "job creation"] highlight [explanation, e.g., "emerging fields like AI ethics"]. This implies [implication, e.g., "skill shifts"], with future benefits [prediction, e.g., "in innovation-driven economies"]. An example is [example, e.g., "Silicon Valley's AI boom generating thousands of tech positions"].

In conclusion, while [summarize predictions, e.g., "job loss is a risk, creation potential is greater"], I anticipate [restate opinion, e.g., "AI fostering net employment growth"], urging [call to action, e.g., "upskilling for the future"].

**Tips**: Use future modals (e.g., "could," "will") for speculation. Suited for tech/society prompts.

### Notebook Integration Tips
