### Simplified IELTS Writing Task 2 Introductions and Conclusions for Education Topics: Drawing from 2025 Trends

The 10 questions are common ones from recent exam data. For each, I've provided 3 sample introductions (50-70 words) and 3 sample conclusions (40-60 words), aiming for band 7+ clarity and coherence.

#### 1. Question: Some people believe that university education should be free for all students. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
   - **Introduction Sample 1**: In an era of widening socioeconomic disparities, the notion that higher education should be universally accessible without financial barriers has gained traction.

   - **Introduction Sample 2**: In a time of growing socioeconomic disparities, the idea that college learning should be open to everyone without cost is becoming more popular.

This strategy not only empowers individuals but also sustains societal progress.
