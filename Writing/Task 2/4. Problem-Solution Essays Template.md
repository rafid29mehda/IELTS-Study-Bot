# IELTS Writing Task 2: 5 Different Templates for Problem-Solution Essays

This guide presents 5 varied templates for IELTS Academic Writing Task 2 Problem-Solution Essays, addressing prompts such as "What are the problems and how can they be solved?" or "Discuss the causes and suggest solutions." These essays require identifying issues, explaining causes/effects, and proposing remedies. Each template features a distinct structure or focus to suit various prompts, ensuring a 250+ word essay that achieves high scores in task response, coherence, lexical resource, and grammatical range for a band 7+ outcome. Templates include sample phrases, explanations, and tips. Incorporate vocabulary from earlier notes (e.g., "To address this" for solutions).

For all templates:
- **Word Count Guide**: Introduction (40-60 words), Each Body (80-100 words), Conclusion (40-50 words).
- **General Tips**: Paraphrase the prompt comprehensively. Use cause-effect linkers (e.g., "this leads to," "consequently"). Provide feasible, specific solutions with examples. Link problems directly to solutions for logical flow.

## Template 1: Causes-Effects-Solutions Structure
**Focus**: Outline causes and effects in one body, solutions in another (standard for straightforward prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + Outline problems/solutions.
- Body 1: Causes + Effects + Example.
- Body 2: Solutions + Explanations + Example.
- Conclusion: Summarize + Emphasize importance.

**Detailed Template**:
The escalating issue of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "air pollution in urban areas"] affects millions globally. This essay will examine the primary causes and their impacts before proposing practical solutions.

The root causes include [first cause, e.g., "vehicular emissions and industrial activities"]. These result in [effects, e.g., "respiratory diseases and climate change"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "in Beijing, high smog levels have led to increased hospital admissions, as reported by WHO data"]. Additionally, [second cause, e.g., "deforestation exacerbating the problem through reduced air filtration"].

Effective solutions involve [first solution, e.g., "promoting electric vehicles"]. This could be achieved by [explanation, e.g., "government subsidies encouraging adoption"]. A successful example is [example, e.g., "Norway's incentives, reducing emissions by 40% per EPA statistics"]. Furthermore, [second solution, e.g., "stricter regulations on factories and reforestation campaigns"].

In conclusion, while [restate problems, e.g., "pollution stems from human activities with severe health effects"], implementing [summarize solutions, e.g., "green transport and regulations"] is crucial to [importance, e.g., "safeguard public health and the environment"].

**Tips**: Use for cause-focused prompts. Employ modals (e.g., "could," "should") in solutions for suggestions.

## Template 2: Problem Per Body with Integrated Solutions
**Focus**: Dedicate each body to one problem, integrating its solution (for prompts with multiple distinct issues).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + List problems + Preview solutions.
- Body 1: Problem 1 + Cause/Effect + Solution + Example.
- Body 2: Problem 2 + Cause/Effect + Solution + Example.
- Conclusion: Synthesize + Broader benefits.

**Detailed Template**:
In modern societies, [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "youth unemployment"] poses significant challenges. Key problems are skill mismatches and economic downturns, which can be tackled through education reforms and job creation initiatives.

One major problem is [first problem, e.g., "lack of relevant skills among graduates"]. Caused by [cause, e.g., "outdated curricula"], this leads to [effect, e.g., "prolonged job searches and frustration"]. To resolve this, [solution, e.g., "universities should align programs with market needs"]. For example, [example, e.g., "Germany's apprenticeship model has lowered youth unemployment to 6%, per OECD figures"].

Another issue is [second problem, e.g., "economic recessions reducing opportunities"]. This stems from [cause, e.g., "global market fluctuations"], resulting in [effect, e.g., "social unrest"]. A viable solution is [solution, e.g., "government stimulus packages for startups"]. An illustration is [example, e.g., "Canada's youth employment strategy, creating 100,000 jobs post-2008 crisis"].

In conclusion, addressing [restate problems, e.g., "skill gaps and economic barriers"] via [summarize solutions, e.g., "targeted education and policies"] will yield [benefits, e.g., "a more stable and productive workforce"].

**Tips**: Ideal for multi-problem prompts. Ensure integration with phrases like "To resolve this."

## Template 3: Solutions-First with Problem Refutation
**Focus**: Lead with solutions, refuting potential problems of implementation (persuasive for solution-heavy prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + State problems + Assert solutions' feasibility.
- Body 1: Solution 1 + Benefits + Refute Implementation Issue + Example.
- Body 2: Solution 2 + Benefits + Refute Implementation Issue + Example.
- Conclusion: Reaffirm solutions + Long-term outlook.

**Detailed Template**:
The persistent problem of [paraphrase prompt, e.g., "plastic waste in oceans"] demands urgent action. Although challenges like cost exist, solutions such as bans and recycling are viable and outweigh hurdles.

A primary solution is [first solution, e.g., "single-use plastic bans"]. This offers [benefits, e.g., "reduced marine debris and wildlife protection"]. Critics argue [refute issue, e.g., "economic impacts on industries, but alternatives create jobs"]. For instance, [example, e.g., "EU's ban has cut waste by 30% while boosting biodegradable markets, per European Commission reports"].

Another effective measure is [second solution, e.g., "advanced recycling technologies"]. This provides [benefits, e.g., "resource recovery and circular economy"]. While [refute issue, e.g., "initial investments are high, government incentives offset this"]. An example is [example, e.g., "Japan's recycling plants, achieving 80% efficiency and economic gains"].

In conclusion, by adopting [restate solutions, e.g., "bans and recycling"], we can overcome [problems, e.g., "ocean pollution"], leading to [outlook, e.g., "sustainable marine ecosystems for future generations"].

**Tips**: Use for optimistic prompts. Refutative language (e.g., "critics argue, but") shows critical analysis.

## Template 4: Global vs. Local Problems and Solutions
**Focus**: Differentiate global/local scales, with tailored solutions (for international/national prompts).

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Paraphrase + Distinguish scales + State integrated solutions.
- Body 1: Global Problem + Solution + Example.
- Body 2: Local Problem + Solution + Example.
- Conclusion: Link scales + Call for action.
