Culture plays a significant role in shaping people’s behavior and attitudes.

### **4. What role does music play in your culture?**

Music plays a central role in my culture, serving as both a form of expression and a way to preserve history and traditions. Traditional music, such as folk songs or classical performances, is often used in ceremonies, festivals, and celebrations. It also helps convey emotions and stories that have been passed down through generations. Additionally, music is a social activity that brings people together, whether it’s singing together at a family gathering or attending a concert or performance. In modern times, music continues to play a role in shaping the identity of young people and influencing popular culture.

### **5. Why do you think people continue to follow cultural practices?**

People continue to follow cultural practices because these traditions provide a sense of identity and continuity. Cultural practices connect individuals to their heritage, offering a sense of belonging to something greater than themselves. They also serve as a way to preserve the values and beliefs of previous generations, ensuring that important lessons and customs are not lost. Furthermore, participating in cultural practices creates strong emotional bonds within communities and families, helping people feel more connected to each other. Even in an increasingly globalized world, these practices offer comfort, familiarity, and pride.

### **6. Do you think globalization is affecting local cultures?**

Yes, globalization is significantly affecting local cultures, often in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, globalization has led to greater cultural exchange, where people from different parts of the world can share and appreciate each other's traditions, food, art, and customs. However, it has also resulted in the erosion of some traditional practices and the dominance of globalized, often Westernized, cultural trends. Local languages, foods, and customs may be overshadowed by global media and consumer culture. While some cultures adapt and integrate new influences, there is a risk that unique cultural identities may be diluted over time. As a result, many people are working to preserve their heritage while adapting to the globalized world.

#### 1. What are some of the most important cultural traditions in your country?
In many countries, important cultural traditions often revolve around festivals that celebrate heritage, community, and seasonal changes, such as Lunar New Year in East and Southeast Asian cultures, which emphasizes family gatherings and renewal. Other key ones include harvest festivals like Makar Sankranti in India and Nepal, symbolizing gratitude and cultural continuity through rituals and feasts. In diverse nations, traditions like Diwali or Mid-Autumn Festival highlight themes of light, prosperity, and unity, adapting to modern contexts while preserving identity. These practices foster social bonds and economic activity, though urbanization challenges their observance. Overall, they serve as anchors for cultural pride amid global influences.

#### 2. Do you think young people today are interested in traditional cultures?
Yes, young people today show growing interest in traditional cultures, often blending them with modern expressions, as seen in Gen Z's enthusiasm for global phenomena like K-dramas and Indigenous creative projects in 2025. Studies indicate that while some face barriers like digital distractions, many engage through community-based programs and festivals, viewing traditions as sources of identity and fun. In China, for instance, youth are increasingly drawn to intangible heritage, driven by cultural pride and innovative projects. However, declining happiness among youth globally may shift focus, yet initiatives like UNESCO's efforts boost participation. Ultimately, this interest reflects a desire for meaningful connections in a fast-changing world.

#### 3. How does culture affect people’s behavior and attitudes?
Culture profoundly shapes behavior and attitudes by influencing values, social norms, and cognitive processes, with research showing it affects everything from emotion regulation to decision-making in diverse contexts. For example, individualistic cultures promote independence in attitudes, while collectivist ones emphasize harmony and conformity, impacting reactions to social norms. In 2025 studies, cultural factors like identity and belonging guide motivation for behavior change, with affective and cognitive appeals varying by cultural dimensions. This interplay can lead to adaptive behaviors but also challenges in multicultural settings. Overall, understanding cultural influences is key for effective social interventions.

#### 4. What role does music play in your culture?
Music plays a central role in cultures worldwide, serving as a medium for preserving heritage, fostering unity, and expressing identity, as seen in its integration into festivals and daily life across diverse societies. In 2025, global trends highlight music's economic and cultural impact, with genres like K-pop promoting cross-cultural dialogue and inclusivity. It connects communities, as in Indigenous traditions where it aids healing and storytelling, or in urban settings where it drives social movements. Music's universal appeal breaks barriers, enhancing empathy and cultural exchange. Ultimately, it remains a vital tool for emotional expression and societal cohesion.

#### 5. Why do you think people continue to follow cultural practices?
People continue following cultural practices due to their role in providing identity, belonging, and psychological support, as psychology research in 2025 shows traditions offer comfort and resilience amid change. Social norms and cultural psychology reinforce adherence, with practices shaping behaviors through shared values and reducing uncertainty. In diverse contexts, they maintain mental health and community ties, as seen in Indigenous healing traditions challenging Western psychology. Despite globalization, people cling to them for continuity and meaning. Overall, this persistence reflects an innate human need for cultural anchoring.

#### 6. Do you think globalization is affecting local cultures?
Yes, globalization is significantly affecting local cultures by promoting hybridization and exchange, but also leading to homogenization and erosion of traditions, as 2025 studies on cultural security note intensified concerns from global flows. It facilitates positive impacts like enriched diversity and economic opportunities, yet risks cultural loss through dominant global norms. Research highlights dual effects, with languages and identities shifting, as in Asia where youth blend global and local elements. While it broadens access, it can exacerbate inequalities. Ultimately, mindful globalization can preserve heritage through balanced integration.
