#### 3. Do you think that social media has a positive or negative effect on society?

In 2025, studies reveal both good (e.g., positive community for children) and ugly sides (e.g., societal security threats from misinformation), with a net negative perception among 64% of Americans historically persisting. While it enables information sharing, overuse leads to social comparison and mental health declines. Overall, balanced regulation could tilt toward positives, but current trends lean negative without intervention.

#### 4. What are the effects of globalization on local cultures?
Globalization affects local cultures by fostering exchange and fusion of elements, leading to enriched diversity and economic opportunities, but also threatening traditions through homogenization and corporate dominance. In 2025, studies show positive impacts like wider access to global knowledge and cultural blending, yet negatives such as erosion of local identities and increased inequality in standards of living. It has flattened some traditions, replacing them with global norms, while enabling local cultures to reach wider audiences amid technological and economic shifts.

In 2025, key actions include narrowing income gaps between top and bottom earners, enhancing social protection, and promoting fair tax systems to support vulnerable groups. Research emphasizes making economic inequality a policy priority, such as through progressive taxation and opportunity enhancements like internships and mentorships. Monitoring progress via data and implementing government programs like welfare and health care can further bridge divides. Overall, a combination of policy cocktails and inclusive education is essential for sustainable equity.

#### 6. How important is it to have a good relationship with your neighbors?
Having good relationships with neighbors is highly important, as it boosts well-being, health, and community cohesion, with studies showing trusting neighbors correlate to higher life satisfaction globally. In 2025, research indicates that knowing just six neighbors can reduce mortality risk by 54.7% for those living alone and improve mental health through social support. Neighborhood ties provide practical help during crises and foster safety, especially for older adults, where continuity enhances quality of life. Events like Neighbour Day underscore reduced loneliness and increased support-seeking, making such bonds vital for resilience. Ultimately, they contribute to stronger, safer communities.

#### 7. Do you think people are becoming more or less socially connected?
People are becoming less socially connected in some ways due to digital exhaustion and social fatigue, with 2025 trends showing Gen Z struggling with in-person interactions amid online dominance. Surveys reveal no gender differences in loneliness, but broader disconnection persists, exacerbated by algorithm-driven platforms fostering selective engagement. In 2025, while hyperscale social video enhances some ties, overall trends indicate worsening authenticity and negativity on social media. Community engagement rises through compensated participation, yet digital-native generations seek balance amid exhaustion. Overall, connections are shifting to shallower forms, necessitating efforts for genuine interactions.
