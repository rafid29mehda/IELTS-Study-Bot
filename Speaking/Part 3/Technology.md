### IELTS Speaking Part 3: Technology

#### 1. How has technology changed the way we communicate?
Technology has revolutionized communication by enabling instant, multimedia interactions through platforms like AI-powered chatbots and video calls, making it more accessible and personalized than traditional methods. In 2025, trends such as voice-enabled tools and AI integration have shifted focus to hybrid work and customer engagement, allowing for real-time global connections but reducing face-to-face nuances. This evolution has made communication faster and more versatile, with features like automated personalization enhancing efficiency, though it raises concerns about authenticity. Overall, while it bridges distances, it demands adaptation to maintain meaningful relationships. In my view, balancing tech with human elements is key for future interactions.

#### 2. What are the positive and negative impacts of technology on society?
Technology's positive impacts include enhanced connectivity and productivity, fostering global collaboration and access to information that drives innovation and economic growth. However, negatives like privacy erosion, social isolation, and mental health degradation from overuse highlight a digital divide and cultural shifts. In 2025, AI's role amplifies these, with benefits in healthcare but risks in job displacement and misinformation. Society must address ethical concerns to maximize positives while mitigating harms like addiction. Ultimately, thoughtful regulation can tip the balance toward net good.

#### 3. Do you think technology has improved our quality of life?
Yes, technology has significantly improved quality of life by advancing healthcare, such as through personalized diagnostics, and enabling convenient smart homes that enhance daily efficiency. In 2025, innovations like AI-optimized manufacturing and preventive health shifts have made lives more connected and sustainable, reducing manual labor burdens. However, uneven distribution means not all benefit equally, with some facing tech-induced stress or inequality. Overall, when accessible, it elevates well-being through better education and entertainment. In my opinion, inclusive adoption is crucial for widespread gains.

#### 4. Do you believe that the rise of automation will result in job losses?
The rise of automation will indeed lead to job losses in routine sectors, with predictions estimating 92 million roles displaced by 2030, though net job creation could offset much of this. In 2025, AI has already caused 77,999 tech layoffs, signaling shifts in roles like data entry, but it also creates demand for AI-related skills. While Goldman Sachs forecasts 300 million jobs at risk globally, reskilling can mitigate impacts, leading to more valuable human roles. Societies need proactive policies to support transitions. Ultimately, automation boosts productivity but requires adaptation to avoid widespread unemployment.

#### 5. How can technology be used in education?
Technology enhances education through AI tools like personalized learning platforms and interactive games, making lessons engaging and adaptive to individual needs. In 2025, trends such as HyFlex models with AI for hybrid teaching and microlearning apps streamline access and well-being in higher education. Tools like SchoolAI and NotebookLM automate tasks, freeing teachers for deeper interactions, while social-emotional learning tech supports holistic development. It bridges gaps in remote areas via digital resources. Overall, thoughtful integration can transform traditional classrooms into dynamic environments.

#### 6. What do you think the future of technology looks like?
The future of technology in 2025 and beyond features agentic AI, quantum computing, and 6G connectivity, enabling autonomous systems and immersive realities that reshape industries. Trends like post-quantum cryptography and AI governance will address security, while spatial computing enhances human-machine collaboration. Emerging tech such as structural battery composites and advanced nuclear systems promise sustainable energy and health breakthroughs. Regional competitions may drive innovation, but ethical scaling is vital. In my view, it holds potential for solving global challenges if guided responsibly.

#### 7. Are there any risks of relying too much on technology?
Over-reliance on technology poses risks like supply chain vulnerabilities and data breaches, with organizations facing heightened digital threats in 2025. It can erode skills through automation dependence, leading to errors in high-stakes scenarios and compromising sovereignty via centralized platforms. In workplaces, AI overdependence threatens job vulnerability and ethical lapses, while cyber risks amplify financial instability. Balancing with human oversight is essential. Ultimately, diversification reduces these dangers.

#### 8. Do you think the younger generation uses technology more wisely than older generations?
Younger generations like Gen Z use technology more wisely in areas like AI adoption, with 70% engaging weekly for professional and immersive content, showing savvy navigation. Compared to older cohorts, they prioritize digital natives' habits, with 86% viewing tech as essential, but may overlook privacy due to constant exposure. In 2025, Gen Z's attitudes toward interactive media reflect wiser integration, though both generations face overuse risks. Elders often use it more cautiously for basics. Overall, wisdom varies by context, with youth leading innovation but needing guidance on balance.
