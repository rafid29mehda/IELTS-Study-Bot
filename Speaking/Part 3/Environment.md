Additionally, states can lead by example in 2025, accelerating clean energy projects and countering deregulation trends to ensure long-term protection. Education campaigns and incentives for green technologies would further amplify impact.

#### 4. What role do individuals play in protecting the environment?
Individuals are pivotal in environmental protection by adopting sustainable habits, such as reducing waste and energy use, which collectively lower global emissions significantly. Through advocacy, like participating in community clean-ups or supporting eco-friendly policies, people can influence broader change and hold corporations accountable. In 2025, personal choices in consumption, like choosing plant-based diets or reusable products, directly combat issues like deforestation and pollution. While systemic action is needed, individual responsibility fosters a culture of sustainability, inspiring others and amplifying grassroots movements.

#### 5. Do you think the government should encourage people to use public transportation?
Absolutely, governments should promote public transport to cut emissions, as it can reduce greenhouse gases by up to 30% per person compared to private cars. Incentives like subsidies, expanded networks, and zero-emission vehicles from 2025 onward would make it more appealing and accessible. This not only eases urban congestion and improves air quality but also supports equity by aiding low-income groups. In my view, integrating it with EV infrastructure could accelerate decarbonization. Such encouragement aligns with global sustainability goals.

#### 6. How can people reduce their carbon footprint?
People can lower their carbon footprint by shifting to energy-efficient appliances and renewables, potentially cutting emissions by 20-30% through simple home upgrades. Adopting low-carbon travel, like biking or public transit, and reducing flights saves significant CO2, while dietary changes—less meat—can halve food-related emissions. In 2025, using apps for tracking and offsetting, plus minimizing waste via recycling, offers practical steps. Collective actions, like supporting green suppliers, amplify impact. Starting small builds momentum for larger changes.

#### 7. Why do some people ignore environmental issues?
Some ignore environmental issues due to psychological distance, perceiving them as distant or abstract, which reduces urgency and motivation for action. Skepticism fueled by misinformation or denial, often amplified by media, leads to dismissal, as surveys show varying beliefs in human-caused change. In 2025, overload from daily stresses or economic priorities overshadows long-term concerns, with some viewing solutions as costly. Political polarization also plays a role, where climate is seen as partisan. Education and relatable messaging could bridge this gap.

#### 8. Do you think people in your country are concerned about the environment?
In many countries, including mine, public concern is high, with global surveys showing a median of 67% viewing climate change as a major threat in 2025. Eurobarometer data indicates 85% of Europeans see it as serious, reflecting broader trends in impacted regions. However, while awareness grows, action varies due to barriers like cost, though polls reveal strong support for policies in places like the US (77%). In my experience, urban youth drive this concern through activism. Overall, it's increasing but needs translation into behavior.
