### **6. How important is mental health compared to physical health?**

Both mental and physical health are equally important and deeply interconnected. Physical health can affect mental well-being; for example, chronic illness can lead to depression, while regular physical activity can improve mood and reduce stress. Similarly, mental health issues like anxiety or depression can negatively affect physical health by causing symptoms such as fatigue, poor sleep, or changes in appetite. A healthy mind supports a healthy body, and vice versa. Therefore, it's essential to take care of both aspects, as they are both crucial for leading a fulfilling and healthy life.

### **7. What do you think are the biggest health challenges in your country?**

In my country, some of the biggest health challenges include obesity, heart disease, and mental health issues. Obesity is a growing concern, particularly among children and teenagers, due to poor dietary habits, lack of physical activity, and the increasing availability of processed foods. Heart disease is also prevalent, partly due to high levels of smoking, unhealthy diets, and high-stress lifestyles. Mental health is another significant challenge, with increasing numbers of people experiencing conditions like anxiety, depression, and stress, especially among the younger population. The healthcare system is working to address these issues, but there is still a need for greater awareness and preventive measures.

#### 1. What do you think is the most effective way to stay healthy?
The most effective way to stay healthy involves a multifaceted approach combining balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, quality sleep, and stress management, as emphasized in expert recommendations for 2025. For instance, adopting diets like the NIH-supported DASH plan, which focuses on heart-healthy foods, has been ranked top for reducing high blood pressure and overall wellness. Incorporating preventive measures such as exercise (about 3.5 hours weekly) and mindfulness practices not only prevents chronic diseases but also enhances longevity and mental well-being. In my view, consistency in these habits, tailored to individual needs, yields the best results, supported by emerging trends in personalized wellness. Ultimately, integrating social connections and avoiding harmful behaviors like excessive alcohol amplifies these benefits.

#### 2. Why do you think some people are more prone to health problems than others?
Some people are more prone to health problems due to a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors, but recent studies show lifestyle and socio-economic conditions have a greater influence than genes alone. For example, epigenetic changes from behaviors like poor diet or smoking can alter gene expression, increasing risks for diseases, while genetics play a role in baseline susceptibility. In 2025, research highlights that unhealthy lifestyles offset genetic advantages, with factors like sedentary habits and pollution exacerbating issues like heart disease. Socio-economic disparities also contribute, as limited access to resources heightens vulnerability. Overall, while genetics set the stage, modifiable factors like environment and habits determine outcomes, emphasizing prevention.

#### 3. How do you think a person’s lifestyle affects their health?
A person's lifestyle profoundly impacts health by influencing disease risk and longevity, with studies showing that healthy habits like exercise and balanced diets can mitigate up to 60% of genetic predispositions for chronic conditions. Sedentary behaviors and poor nutrition contribute to lifestyle diseases, while positive changes, such as integrated healthy living, slow cognitive decline and extend disease-free years. In 2025, research links favorable lifestyles to reduced risks for outcomes like CVD, diabetes, and depression, even in later life. Environmental and social factors within lifestyles further amplify effects, underscoring the need for holistic approaches. Ultimately, proactive lifestyle adjustments yield significant health dividends.

#### 4. Should the government play a role in promoting healthy living?
Yes, governments should actively promote healthy living through policies and initiatives, as seen in the U.S. establishment of the Make America Healthy Again Commission in 2025 to combat health challenges via federal actions. This includes providing accessible health services, reauthorizing preparedness acts, and implementing nutrition guidelines to encourage better diets and activity. By supporting programs like adult vaccine initiatives and dietary updates, governments can reduce public health burdens and disparities. Their role is essential for systemic change, as individual efforts alone can't address widespread issues. In essence, proactive policies foster a healthier population.

#### 5. Do you think people today have healthier lifestyles than in the past?
People today exhibit mixed healthier lifestyles compared to the past, with greater awareness of wellness trends like longevity-focused products and AI-driven health tools in 2025, but challenges like sedentary work persist. Advances in gut health and performance optimization reflect positive shifts, yet obesity and chronic diseases remain high due to modern conveniences. Surveys indicate increased adoption of science-backed habits, but comparisons show past generations had more physical activity naturally. Overall, while access to information improves choices, urban lifestyles often counteract gains, requiring balanced interventions.

#### 6. How important is mental health compared to physical health?
Mental health is equally important as physical health, with research showing their interconnection—poor mental states exacerbate physical conditions like chronic pain, while addressing both enhances overall well-being. In 2025, studies reveal mental health issues reduce life expectancy by 10-25 years in severe cases, underscoring the need for integrated care. Physical activity improves mental states, reducing anxiety, but untreated mental health hinders physical recovery. Prioritizing mental health is vital, as it influences daily functioning and resilience. Ultimately, a holistic view treats them as interdependent.

#### 7. What do you think are the biggest health challenges in your country?
Globally, and in many countries including mine, the biggest health challenges in 2025 include noncommunicable diseases like heart disease and obesity, compounded by pandemic setbacks and climate impacts. Mental health crises, workforce shortages, and rising costs strain systems, with cardiovascular issues and substance abuse topping lists. Emerging threats like infectious diseases and health inequities persist, requiring resilient infrastructure. In my view, addressing these demands policy focus on prevention and equity to curb escalating burdens.
