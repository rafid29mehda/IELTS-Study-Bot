Practice these by timing yourself and expanding with personal details for authenticity. For higher bands, incorporate idioms (e.g., "step out of one's comfort zone") and complex structures. If preparing a research interest statement for IELTS-related studies, emphasize how such topics reveal cultural insights or language acquisition patterns.
