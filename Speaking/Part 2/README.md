Pohela Baishakh is important because it presents our cultural identity and brings people together. It’s a time when Bengalis reconnect with their heritage, regardless of their religion or social status. The tradition fosters a sense of unity and pride. It also reminds us of our roots and values.

One piece of art that I am really fond of is the famous painting called the "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo da Vinci. It's a famous oil painting depicting a woman with a mysterious smile. This painting is widely regarded as one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of art.

Although I have never seen the original painting in person, I have seen numerous pictures of it and even watched documentaries about its history and significance. The original is kept in the Louvre Museum in Paris and attracts millions of visitors every year. What I find so captivating about this painting is the artist’s meticulous attention to detail, the soft shading technique called sfumato, and the way the smile seems to change depending on the viewer’s perspective. There is also a lot of mystery surrounding who the woman really was, which adds to the painting's allure.

They can sense emotions and provide comfort when someone feels sad or stressed. Another quality I really like is their playfulness. They enjoy activities like running, playing fetch, or simply going for long walks.

I also find dogs admirable because they are incredibly useful animals. For example, many dogs help people with disabilities, such as guide dogs for the blind. Some are trained to rescue people during emergencies or work with the police. This shows their intelligence and ability to bond with people on a deep level.

Although I don’t have a dog currently, I plan to get one in the near future as they bring a lot of joy, happiness and positive energy into a home.

The area is also very secure, with security guards and CCTV cameras everywhere, which makes residents feel safe.

#### Describe an important rule at your school or college. You should say:

* **What the rule is**
* **How it is enforced**
* **Why it is important**
* **And explain how you feel about this rule."**

One important rule at my university is that students must attend at least 75% of their classes to be eligible for the final exams. This rule means that if a student misses more than 25% of classes, they will not be allowed to sit for the exams, regardless of their performance in assignments or projects. The rule is strictly enforced through an attendance tracking system where teachers mark attendance every class. If a student is absent, it’s recorded, and the total attendance percentage is monitored regularly. If a student's attendance drops below the required percentage, they are given a warning and may be asked to leave the course. This rule ensures that students stay committed to their studies and don't miss out on crucial lessons. It encourages regular participation and helps improve the overall learning experience. It also promotes discipline and responsibility. Personally, I believe this rule is fair and important because it motivates students to be more responsible about their education. Although sometimes it can be a bit strict, it helps maintain a high standard of learning and ensures that no one is left behind due to lack of attendance."

#### Describe a skill you learned from your elder.

Cooking traditional Bengali dishes is a skill I learned from my grandmother, during my childhood visits to her home in Netrokona. Netrokona is a northern district of Bangladesh. Growing up, I spent many afternoons in the kitchen with my grandmother, watching her prepare a variety of dishes, from bhorta (mashed vegetables) to panta bhat (fermented rice). The learning wasn’t just about following recipes—it was about understanding the essence of Bengali flavors. She taught me how to balance spices, the importance of using fresh mustard oil, and the significance of slow cooking to allow the flavors to blend together. She always emphasized using seasonal ingredients and cooking with love. To me, cooking feels like not only a creative skill but also a form of art. I enjoy cooking. It serves as a way for me to unwind and relax after a busy day or week. It gives me a sense of satisfaction when I see others enjoying my prepared meal. Another reason I enjoy cooking is because it connects me with my culture and heritage. I am forever grateful to my beloved grandmother for teaching me this creative skill.


#### Describe a creativity skill you admire.

A creativity skill that I admire is photography. It captures moments, depicts emotions, and tells stories through visuals. I first became fascinated by it when 2 years ago, I visited few exhibitions of various photographers' works. What I find most impressive about photography is the photographer's capacity to observe the world in a unique way, from landscapes to portraits, showing how they use elements like light, angles, composition, and timing to create art from everyday scenes.

I enjoy photography because it allows me to capture and document memories of any moments. Another reason I love photography is that it serves as a great way to unwind and relax after a busy week. Sometimes, after a stressful or hectic day, I just grab my camera and head outside. Walking around nature and city lights and taking photos helps me clear my mind. It’s like a form of therapy for me. Photography helps me disconnect from my daily worries and reconnect with the world in a peaceful and creative way.

#### Describe a teacher you admire

One teacher who made a significant impact on my education was my math teacher, Mr. Riaz during high school in Dhaka. He was not only an excellent mathematician but also someone who taught us important life values like discipline, hard work, and kindness. Mr. Riaz had a unique ability to explain even the most complex math problems, breaking them down step by step to make them easy to understand. He was always kind and patient, especially when someone struggled with a concept, and he would take the time to ensure we fully understood. I can still remember, there was a time when I was falling behind due to family issues, and he showed genuine kindness, offering to review missed concepts during lunch breaks without making me feel embarrassed. Moreover, he always motivated us to believe in ourselves and work hard to pursue our dreams. Mr Riaz has been a constant source of inspiration in my life. He is someone I look up to, and his influence has played a huge role in shaping who I am today. Overall, his life has shaped my values, and I hope to live up to the example he has set.


#### Describe a subject you enjoyed learning in school.

A subject I really enjoyed learning in school was mathematics, which I studied throughout my primary and secondary years at a local public school in my hometown. From basic arithmetic in early grades to more advanced topics like algebra and geometry in high school, math always felt like a puzzle waiting to be solved. Our teacher made it engaging by using games, real-life problems, and group activities, which turned math solving into exciting challenges. Math also helped me develop critical thinking and logical reasoning, skills that I still use today.


I remember how excited and thrilled I used to get when I cracked any complex problems. Unlike subjects that relied on memorization, math encouraged critical thinking and creativity in finding solutions. It has been incredibly useful in my daily life, from managing personal finance to analyzing data in my job as a data analytics.

#### Describe a healthy habit you have developed recently

A healthy habit I've developed recently is maintaining a balanced daily routine that focuses on a nutritious diet, staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, and doing light exercise in the early morning. I used to eat a lot of junk food, especially fast food, which made me feel sluggish and tired. However, I realized that what I eat plays a huge role in how I feel throughout the day. Now I try to include more vegetables and fruits in my meals. Drinking more water has also been a big change for me. I used to struggle with staying hydrated, but after learning about the importance of water for overall health, I decided to drink more. Now I have started to carry a water bottle with me wherever I go. Additionally, I’ve aimed for around 7-8 hours of sleep every night, which has really helped improve my energy levels and skin health. Lastly, I’ve added some light exercise in the early mornings, like a quick walk or stretching, which helps me feel more active and focused. My productivity throughout the day has increased significantly. This new balanced routine has made me feel healthier, and more energetic. 


#### Describe a social issue that is important to you

One social issue that is very important to me is environmental pollution and climate change. I have always been concerned about how pollution, whether in the form of air, water, or soil, is affecting our planet. Urbanization, industrial emissions, deforestation, and the increased use plastics and fossil fuels are contributing to climate change, which has resulted in global warming and extreme weather events like floods, droughts, heatwaves, rising sea levels, and ultimately loss of biodiversity. This matters to me because it affects our society and everyone's future, so I try to reduce my carbon footprint by reducing waste, preserving water, using public transport, supporting businesses that prioritize sustainable products. To address environmental pollution and climate change, we need collective actions: Government must implement policies and regulations that promote environmental protection, such as carbon taxes and renewable energy incentives. On the other hand, corporations have the responsibility to adopt sustainable practices in their operations, such as reducing emissions and prioritizing eco-friendly production. Raising awareness and encouraging sustainable practices are key steps toward a healthier planet.


#### Describe a time when you witnessed a crime or a dangerous situation. (talk about pickpocketing)
  * You should say:
    * What happened
    * Where you were
    * What you did when you saw it
    * And explain what you think should have been done in that situation

Last year, I witnessed a pickpocketing incident at a busy market in the city center. It was a crowded Saturday afternoon, I was in the heart of Dhaka's famous Banani Market, surrounded by stalls selling spices, fruits, and clothes.

I was walking past a food stall when I noticed a man moving suspiciously close to an elderly woman who was busy looking at some clothes. The man was pretending to browse through some items on a nearby table, but he was actually trying to reach into her handbag. 

I was standing just a few meters away, so I had a clear view. When I saw it, I immediately shouted "Thief! Stop him!" to alert the victim and surrounding. The woman immediately checked her handbag and saw the purse was not there. Luckily a few shopkeepers noticed it and grabbed the thief's arm before he could escape. We held him until the market security arrived and called the police.

I think this kind of crime could be prevented by having more visible security guards patrolling the area and installing CCTV cameras at key spots. Also, the market authorities could promote awareness campaigns, such as putting up signs reminding people to keep their valuables secure in crowded places. This would make busy markets safer and reduce such crimes that spoil the shopping experience for everyone.
