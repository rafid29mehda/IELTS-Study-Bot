#### Accommodation/Home
Common questions focus on your living situation and preferences.

- **Do you live in a house or a flat?**  
  I live in a spacious flat. It’s on the fourth floor of a medium‑sized apartment building. I find it quit convenient because it’s close to my university and also to some grocery stores.

- **Who do you live with?**  
  I live with my parents and my younger sister. Sharing the flat with them makes daily life more lively and supportive. For instance, my parents often guide me when I feel stressed with my studies, and my sister adds a cheerful atmosphere to the house.

- **What is your favourite room?**  
  My favourite room is definitely my bedroom. It’s the place where I can relax, recharge, and focus on my studies without too many distractions. At the same time, it’s also my personal space where I can listen to music, read, or just unwind. I think I like it most because it reflects my personality and gives me a balance between work and relaxation.

- **What would you change about your home?**  
  If I have to change something about my home, I would probably add more natural light by installing larger windows. As it will make the atmosphere much more energetic and refreshing. Overall, though, I'm satisfied with the space.

- **Do you plan to live there in the future?**  
  Probably not long-term, as I hope to move to a house in the suburbs for more peace and quiet. For now, it's ideal for my current lifestyle.

- **What facilities are there near your home?**  
  There are plenty of facilities like a supermarket, a small park, and a pharmacy is within walking distance, which makes daily life easier. It's also close to public transport, there’s a bus stop right outside the building, so getting around the city is hassle-free.

- **What is your neighbourhood like?**  
  My neighbourhood is vibrant and multicultural, with friendly people and lots of local shops. However, it can get noisy during peak hours due to traffic. But overall, it’s a pleasant place to live.

- **Do most people live in houses in your country?**  
  In my country, many people in rural areas live in houses, but in cities, flats are more common due to space constraints. It depends on the region and economic factors.

#### Animals
Questions explore your views on pets and wildlife.

- **Do you like animals?**  
  Yes, I adore animals because they bring joy and comfort into life. For example, I enjoy watching birds near my home and sometimes even feed stray cats in the neighborhood.

  In my country, the most common pets are dogs and cats. People love keeping dogs because they are loyal and make great companions, and cats are popular for their independent but affectionate nature. Besides these, small animals like birds, and rabbits are also kept as pets by many families. Fish tanks are quite common too, as they add a calming element to homes.

- **Do you think animals should be kept in zoos?**  
  I think zoos can be educational if they're well-managed and focus on conservation, but animals should have spacious enclosures to mimic their natural habitats. Otherwise, it's better to protect them in the wild.

I think animals should not be kept in zoos unless it is for very specific reasons. Like to protect endangered species, provide education to the public, and support conservation efforts. I believe it’s better for animals to live freely in their natural habitats whenever possible, but responsible, well-managed zoos that prioritize animal welfare and conservation can have some benefits.
